bugs:
	none yet.

where I left off:

things to finish for existing features:
	JEI support for sorter belt GUI.
	make redstone transmitters and receivers waterloggable.
	support beam for copper stairs (and other stairs) has texture flipped.

features:
	general:
		config file for disabling non-essential mixins.
	decoration:
		copper slab blocks: texture that resembles polished stone slabs, in the sense that it's clearly split in two.
			use that same texture for copper catwalk stairs.
		catwalk platforms: looks like a catwalk, can be walked on
			still need wooden and gold variants.
		catwalk stairs: includes rails on the side
			still need wooden and gold variants.
		more ladder variants: iron, gold, copper, and wood.
			metal ones can be free-standing.
		decorative lightning rod: summons lightning on demand, does not generate lightning power
	transport:
		belts:
		hoppers:
			wooden hopper: spits out items into the world. significantly less random velocity than droppers. can't insert into inventories.
			stone hopper: this is the vanilla hopper, just with a cheaper recipe
			iron hopper: extracts from whichever slot has the fewest items. ties are broken by slot index.
			golden hopper: extracts from whichever slot has the most items in it. ties are broken by slot index.
			quartz hopper: extracts from a random slot
		teleport sender: teleports entities to any available teleport receivers when it receives a lightning pulse.
		teleport receiver: does not require power, works as a block, as a dropped item, and in a player's inventory.
	lightning power:
		lightning jar: stores lightning power as a block. releases power when it receives a redstone signal.
		lightning electrode: stores lightning power in portable, item format. releases power on right click.
		resurrector: uses lightning power and mob drops to summon the mob that drops those items
		silver iodide cannon: used to make it rain. if it's already raining, it'll start storming.
		lightning enchanter: uses lightning power to enchant items
		magnetite:
			armor: attracts items, xp, and projectiles. so ya know. pros and cons
			arrow: is attracted to mobs
	lasers:
		redstone detector: detects a redstone laser passing through the block
		lightning transmitter: on lightning pulse, emits a beam
		lightning receiver: when hit by a lightning beam, spreads the lightning pulse to the position of the receiver
		thermal discouragement beam: ignites entities that touch the beam
		tripwire beam: emits a redstone signal when an entity touches the beam
		spotlight: illuminates every block the beam goes through
		mirror: reflects beams so that they go somewhere else
		prism: can split up a laser into several others
		beam obscurator: makes laser beams invisible
		beam revealer: makes laser beams visible again
		crystal clusters:
			make spawn in caves and in rocks.
	automation:
		upgraded crafting tables:
			wood: unchanged
			stone: keeps its inventory when you close the GUI
			iron: basically a placeable version of the techno crafter
		deployer: places blocks.
		destroyer: breaks blocks.
		block excavator: upgraded version of the block breaker which can mine entire ore veins at once
		block harvester: upgraded version of the block breaker which can chop down entire trees at once
		ignitor: smelts items on top of it, sets entities on fire
		XP storage device: not sure about the details yet.
		miner: vehicle entity which can be ridden. consumes fuel, and breaks blocks on contact.
		radio: computercraft integration which allows you to control miners remotely, without a driver.
		spawner jammer: disables spawners unless powered by redstone. can also consume mobs and regular chicken eggs and produce spawn eggs in the process.
	redstone:
		pulsar: emits regularly timed redstone pulses
	tools:
		portable techno crafter: portable crafting tool, includes 2 crafting grids, a trash can, and keeps its inventory when closed.
		snow cannon: shoots snowballs every tick while you hold down right click
		rail gun: shoots nuggets fast and accurately compared to bows and arrows. consumes power from lightning electrodes.
		power tools: pickaxe works like block excavator, axe works like block harvester. shovel will work on dirt/gravel veins. not sure about the other tools.

done:
	lightning power:
		lightning cable: transfers lightning power without shocking entities
		transmuter: uses lightning power to turn items into other items
		vanilla integration:
			TNT: explode
			blocks made of copper: de-oxidize
			spawner: spawn mobs
		magnetite:
			nugget: crafting ingredient for magnetite arrows
			ingot: crafting ingredient. made by transmuting iron
			block: also attracts items, xp, and projectiles
	transport:
		belts:
			belt: transports entities horizontally
			speedy belt: transports entities faster
			brake belt: slows down (or stops) entities
			director belt: sends items left, right, or straight based on redstone signals
			detector belt: emits a redstone signal when entities are on top of it
			trapdoor belt: on redstone signal (invertable), opens and allows entities to drop straight through it. can be placed in mid air.
			sorter belt: sorts entities left or right with a filter GUI
			ejector belt: extracts items from chests, and xp from the xp storage block, on redstone pulse.
			injector belt: inserts items into adjacent inventories.
			launcher belt: launches entities upwards
		ascender/descender: transports entities vertically
	decoration:
		frames: looks like scaffolding, can be climbed like a ladder
	redstone:
		encased redstone block: emits a redstone signal in only one direction
		encased slime block: only sticks to other blocks on one side. doesn't stick to honey blocks.
			encased honey block: same. but doesn't stick to slime blocks.
	lasers:
		redstone transmitter: transmits a redstone signal across a large distance
		redstone receiver: receives a signal from a redstone transmitter
		crystal clusters:
			boosts the distance of lasers passing through it.
		lens: placed on prisms to control their outputs. also used for crafting lasers.

canceled:
	lightning rod: already in vanilla.
