bugs:
	none yet.

where I left off:
	try to reduce number of packets sent while entities are inside ascenders/descenders.
	make belts and ascenders/descenders able to insert items into inventories.
	prevent items and xp orbs from stacking while on conveyors or in ascenders.
	JEI support for sorter belt GUI.

features:
	general:
	decoration:
		frames: looks like scaffolding, can be climbed like a ladder
		platforms: looks like a catwalk, can be walked on
		platform stairs: includes rails on the side
		decorative lightning rod: summons lightning on demand, does not generate lightning power
	transport:
		belts:
			ejector belt: extracts items from chests, and xp from the xp storage block, on redstone signal.
		hoppers:
			wooden hopper: spits out items into the world. significantly less random velocity than droppers. can't insert into inventories.
			stone hopper: this is the vanilla hopper, just with a cheaper recipe
			iron hopper: extracts from whichever slot has the fewest items. ties are broken by slot index.
			golden hopper: extracts from whichever slot has the most items in it. ties are broken by slot index.
			quartz hopper: extracts from a random slot
		teleport sender: teleports entities to any available teleport receivers when it receives a lightning pulse.
		teleport receiver: does not require power, works as a block, as a dropped item, and in a player's inventory.
	lightning power:
		lightning rod: generates lightning power
		lightning cable: transfers lightning power without shocking entities
		lightning jar: stores lightning power as a block. releases power when it receives a redstone signal.
		lightning electrode: stores lightning power in portable, item format. releases power on right click.
		transmutation chamber: uses lightning power to turn items into other items
		resurrector: uses lightning power and mob drops to summon the mob that drops those items
		silver iodide cannon: used to make it rain. if it's already raining, it'll start storming.
		lightning enchanter: uses lightning power to enchant items
		vanilla integration:
			lightning pulses going through TNT will make it explode
			lightning pulses going through a spawner will make it spawn mobs
	lasers:
		redstone transmitter: transmits a redstone signal across a large distance
		redstone receiver: receivs a signal from a redstone transmitter
		redstone detector: detects a redstone laser passing through the block
		thermal discouragement beam: roasts entities that touch the beam
		tripwire laser: emits a redstone signal when an entity touches the beam
		spotlight: places light source blocks everywhere the laser goes
		mirror: reflects beams so that they go somewhere else
		prism: can split up a laser into several others
		lens: placed on prisms to control their outputs. also used for crafting lasers.
		beam obscurator: makes laser beams invisible
		beam revealer: makes laser beams visible again
		crystal clusters: boosts the distance of lasers passing through it.
	automation:
		upgraded crafting tables:
			wood: unchanged
			stone: keeps its inventory when you close the GUI
			iron: allows automation via hoppers. crafts when given a redstone signal.
			gold: has a template section that can be used to configure where items go. redstone signal not required.
		deployer: places blocks.
		destroyer: breaks blocks.
		block excavator: upgraded version of the block breaker which can mine entire ore veins at once
		block harvester: upgraded version of the block breaker which can chop down entire trees at once
		ignitor: smelts items on top of it, sets entities on fire
		XP storage device: not sure about the details yet.
		miner: vehicle entity which can be ridden. consumes fuel, and breaks blocks on contact.
		radio: computercraft integration which allows you to control miners remotely, without a driver.
		spawner jammer: disables spawners unless powered by redstone. can also consume mobs and regular chicken eggs and produce spawn eggs in the process.
	redstone:
		pulsar: emits regularly timed redstone pulses
		directional redstone block: emits a redstone signal in only one direction
	tools:
		power crafter: portable crafting tool, includes 2 crafting grids, a trash can, and keeps its inventory when closed.
		snow cannon: shoots snowballs every tick while you hold down right click
		rail gun: shoots nuggets fast and accurately compared to bows and arrows. consumes power from lightning electrodes.
		power tools: pickaxe works like block excavator, axe works like block harvester. shovel will work on dirt/gravel veins. not sure about the other tools.

			brake belt: slows down (or stops) entities
			director belt: sends items left, right, or straight based on redstone signals
