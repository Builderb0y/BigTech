bugs:
	none yet.

where I left off:
	make destroyers play tool breaking sound when breaking a tool.
	check for empty tags when creating json files in data gen.
	make miner display on inside which blocks it is about to break.
		4 lights for "below the miner", "at the base of the miner", "at the top of the miner", and "above the miner".

things to finish for existing features:
	JEI support for sorter belt (click and dragging items into the GUI).
	JEI support for transmuter (recipe lookup).
	arc furnace:
		more recipes:
			sand -> silicon
				used for redstone logic gates.
			iron + redstone -> redstone ingot?
				redstone lasers?
			gold + lapis -> lapis ingot?
				what would this be used for?
				lapis frame?
			gold + glowstone dust -> glowing ingot?
				spotlight.
	better placement:
		toggle for:
			if you're looking at the block you just placed, don't place a new block.
			if you're looking at a different block, place immediately.
	electrum:
		use in lightning transmitter recipe somewhere.

compatibility:

testing:

1.21.5:

features:
	general:
		chunk loader.
	materials:
	decoration:
		fancier 3D models for things.
			more vanilla stuff?
				beacons?
				brewing stands (inventory)
	transport:
		hoppers:
			copper hopper: ??? maybe filterable somehow?
			iron hopper: extracts from whichever slot has the fewest items. ties are broken by slot index.
			golden hopper: extracts from whichever slot has the most items in it. ties are broken by slot index.
			quartz hopper: extracts from a random slot
		teleport sender: teleports entities to any available teleport receivers when it receives a lightning pulse.
		teleport receiver: does not require power, works as a block, as a dropped item, and in a player's inventory.
	lightning power:
		socks:
			when walking across carpet or wool while wearing them,
			charges lightning electrodes in your inventory.
			slowly though. like 1 unit per 10 ticks or something.
	automation:
		XP storage device: not sure about the details yet.
	machines:
		pump?
		proximitor?
			alternate name: radar.
			detects nearby entities.
	redstone:
		logic gate crafting table.
			crafted with silicon plates.
			uses silicon plates and redstone to make logic gates.
			powered by firing a redstone transmitter downwards at it.
	tools:
		snow cannon: shoots snowballs every tick while you hold down right click
		rail gun: shoots nuggets fast and accurately compared to bows and arrows. consumes power from lightning electrodes.
		power tools: can mine multiple blocks? kind of similar to the destroyer?
		nightvision goggles.
		infrared goggles?
		glowing goggles?

done:
	lightning power:
		cooler looking lightning
		lightning cable: transfers lightning power without shocking entities
		lightning diode: only lets lightning energy travel through it in one direction.
		transmuter: uses lightning power to turn items into other items
		vanilla integration:
			TNT: explode
			blocks made of copper: de-oxidize
			spawner: spawn mobs
		magnetite:
			nugget: crafting ingredient for magnetite arrows
			ingot: crafting ingredient. made by transmuting iron
			block: also attracts items, xp, and projectiles
			arrow: is attracted to mobs
			armor: attracts items, xp, and projectiles. so ya know, pros and cons. don't wear this armor while fighting skeletons.
		tesla coil: shocks nearby entities, can summon lightning
		lightning jar: stores lightning power as a block. releases power when it receives a redstone signal.
		lightning battery: stores lightning power in portable, item format. releases power on right click.
		silver iodide cannon: used to make it rain. if it's already raining, it'll start thundering.
		conductive anvil: uses lightning power to transfer enchantments from one item to another item.
		lightning transmitter: on lightning pulse, emits a beam that spreads the pulse to any blocks it hits.
	transport:
		wooden hopper: spits out items into the world. velocity of ejected items is not randomized. can't insert into inventories.
		stone hopper: this is the vanilla hopper, just with a cheaper recipe.
		belts:
			belt: transports entities horizontally
			speedy belt: transports entities faster
			brake belt: slows down (or stops) entities
			director belt: sends items left, right, or straight based on redstone signals
			detector belt: emits a redstone signal when entities are on top of it
			trapdoor belt: on redstone signal (invertable), opens and allows entities to drop straight through it. can be placed in mid air.
			sorter belt: sorts entities left or right with a filter GUI
			ejector belt: extracts items from chests, and xp from the xp storage block, on redstone pulse.
			injector belt: inserts items into adjacent inventories.
			launcher belt: launches entities upwards
		ascender/descender: transports entities vertically
	decoration:
		frames: looks like scaffolding.
		catwalk platforms: looks like a catwalk, can be walked on
		catwalk stairs: includes rails on the side
		more ladders: iron and copper.
		copper slab blocks: texture that resembles polished stone slabs, in the sense that it's clearly split in two.
		colored LEDs: useful as a simple status indicator, but does not actually emit light.
	redstone:
		encased redstone block: emits a redstone signal in only one direction
		encased slime block: only sticks to other blocks on one side. doesn't stick to honey blocks.
			encased honey block: same. but doesn't stick to slime blocks.
		pulsar: emits regularly timed redstone pulses.
	lasers:
		redstone transmitter: transmits a redstone signal across a large distance
		redstone receiver: receives a signal from a redstone transmitter
		beam interceptor: detects a laser passing through the block
		tripwire beam: emits a redstone signal when an entity touches the beam
		spotlight: illuminates every block the beam goes through
		thermal discouragement beam: ignites entities that touch the beam
		crystal clusters:
			boosts the distance of lasers passing through it
			spawns on the ceilings of caves
		lens: placed on prisms to control their outputs. also used for crafting lasers.
		mirror: reflects beams so that they go somewhere else
		prism: can split up a beam into several others, or merge several beams into one.
		phase scrambler: makes laser beams invisible and undetectable by redstone components
		phase aligner: makes laser beams visible and detectable by redstone components again
		vanilla interactions:
			glass: beams pass right through.
			stained glass: beams change color when passing through, but do not get boosted.
			beacons: beams get boosted by 32 blocks per level when passing through.
	automation:
		deployer: places blocks.
		destroyer: breaks blocks and ejects them out the back. can destroy entire trees at once.
			comes in 2 variants: long range and short range. long range uses a laser beam to destroy blocks at a distance.
		ignitor: smelts items on top of it, sets entities on fire
		miner: vehicle entity which can be ridden. consumes fuel, and breaks blocks on contact.
		radio: computercraft integration which allows you to control miners remotely, without a driver.
		spawner interceptor: disables spawners when powered by redstone. can also consume mobs and regular chicken eggs and produce spawn eggs in the process.
		upgraded crafting tables:
			wood: unchanged
			stone: keeps its inventory when you close the GUI
			iron: basically a placeable version of the techno crafter
	tools:
		portable techno crafter: portable crafting tool, includes 2 crafting grids, a trash can, and keeps its inventory when closed.
		dislocator: allows you to see and collect blocks in front of you, even when they're behind a wall.

canceled:
	lightning rod: already in vanilla.
	resurrector: unsure how to balance properly, potential for duping.
	lightning receiver: you can just shoot any other conductive block with a lightning beam instead.

when updating to MC 1.20.4/5:
	there is apparently an attribute for player reach distance now.
		use this in all implementations of Inventory.canPlayerUse().
